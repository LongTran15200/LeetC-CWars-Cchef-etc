# Given the beginning of a linked list head, return true if there is a cycle in the linked list. Otherwise, return false.

# There is a cycle in a linked list if at least one node in the list can be visited again by following the next pointer.

# Internally, index determines the index of the beginning of the cycle, if it exists. The tail node of the list will set it's next pointer to the index-th node. If index = -1, then the tail node points to null and no cycle exists.

# Note: index is not given to you as a parameter.

# Input: head = [1,2,3,4], index = 1

# Output: true
# Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 1st node (0-indexed).

# Example 2:
# Input: head = [1,2], index = -1

# Output: false
