### Overview

In this repository, you will find a collection of coding challenges and solutions that I have completed from popular platforms such as **LeetCode**, **CodeWars**, and **CodeChef**. My goal is to **improve my coding skills**, **enhance my problem-solving abilities**, and **strengthen my knowledge of algorithms and data structures** in C++, Java, and Python.

### Goals

- **Learning and Skill Improvement**: Through this repository, I aim to enhance my coding skills by regularly practicing and solving coding challenges. By tackling various problems, I hope to improve my problem-solving abilities, gain a deeper understanding of algorithms and data structures, and become a more proficient programmer.

- **Preparation for Technical Interviews**: These coding challenge platforms often feature interview-style questions. By actively participating and solving these problems, I aim to familiarize myself with the types of challenges commonly asked during technical interviews at top tech companies. This will help me prepare effectively and increase my chances of success in future interviews.

### Repository Contents

The repository will include the following:

- **Solutions**: You will find my solutions to a wide range of coding challenges, organized according to the platform and problem difficulty level. I will provide clear and well-documented code for each problem, showcasing my problem-solving approach and coding style.

- **Code snippets**: Alongside the solutions, I will also provide useful code snippets and explanations that highlight important concepts, algorithms, and data structures I have utilized while solving these challenges. These snippets will serve as a reference for myself and others who may be exploring similar problem domains.

### Stay Connected

Feel free to explore this repository and follow along with my coding journey. I encourage you to provide feedback, suggestions, or improvements on any of my solutions. Let's **learn and grow together**!
