This problem input is a bit confusing. Let me break it down for you.
The first line of input is 4 representing <b>t(number of output will be).</b>
The second line is 4 3. 4 will represent the variable <b>n which determines how many x</b> persons and 3 represents what is the <b>minimum age to vote.</b>
This follows up with the Third line 5 3 1 2 = <b>n people with age</b>. In conclusion, the minimum age to vote is 3 and there are only 5 and 3 can vote.
Therefore, output = 2. After that, every 2 lines is equal to 1 output.
